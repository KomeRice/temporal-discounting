        <pre>
This study is conducted by Gilles Bailly and Evanthia Dimara (Sorbonne University) who will
be delighted to answer your questions (gilles.bailly@sorbonne-universite.fr). This study
was approved by The INSEAD Internal Review Board (reference 201915).

<b>Task:</b> Pick all shapes on the grid that match the target.
A quick 3-step tutorial is here to guide you through the basics:
    - Novice Mode: Manually clicking every shape
    - Expert Mode: Click one to select all shapes
    - Learning Mode: How to unlock Expert Mode

Shapes are not distributed evenly, i.e. some shapes will be more common than others.
Keep an eye out for the timeline to see upcoming shapes. <br />
